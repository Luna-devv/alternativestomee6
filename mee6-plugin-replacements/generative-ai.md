# Generative Ai

### Chat Ai - [Wamellow](https://wamellow.com)

Wamellow's `/ask` and `/meow` commands target to replace MEE6's paid `/write` command. Wamellow lets you choose from Deepseek R1, Gemma 2, over several llama 3.0-3.3 models, mixtral 8, and qwen 2.5 (coder) models. Wamellow supports message splitting, so you can generate responses way over the 2000 character limit. It can also remember previous messages and generate responses based on them.\
_Price: $0_
